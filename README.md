# TCloudDemo

✨ **This workspace has been generated by [Nx, Monorepos](https://nx.dev) with [Angular](https://angular.dev/)** ✨

## Project init

After cloning into this project, first run `npm install` in the project repository to install dependencies required for this project.

## Start the application

Run `npm start` to start the development server.

## Build for production

Run `npm build` to build the application. The build artifacts are stored in the output directory (e.g. `dist/` or `build/`), ready to be deployed.

## Running tasks

To execute tasks with Nx use the following syntax:

``` bash
npx nx <target> <project> <...options>
```

You can also run multiple targets:

``` bash
npx nx run-many -t <target1> <target2>
```

..or add `-p` to filter specific projects

``` bash
npx nx run-many -t <target1> <target2> -p <proj1> <proj2>
```

Targets can be defined in the `package.json` or `projects.json`. Learn more [in the docs](https://nx.dev/features/run-tasks).

## Explore the project graph

Run `npx nx graph` to show the graph of the workspace.
It will show tasks that you can run with Nx.
